# Literary Latte

This is a project created with the concept of a book cafe in mind, to expand my knowledge of React JS, Tailwind CSS, component libraries like Flowbite, animations in React using Framer Motion, state management tools like Context API, Redux toolkit and React Routing.

## Technologies used

### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
### Context API: A React Tool for efficient state management.
### React Router DOM: A library for declarative routing in React applications.
### Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to APIs.
### Tailwind CSS: A CSS framework for building modern web applications.
### Framer Motion: A library for creating fluid animations and interactive UIs in React.
### React Icons: A library of customizable SVG icons for React applications.
### Flowbite and Flowbite React: A UI framework and React components for responsive web design.
### React Toastify: A library for displaying toast notifications in React applications.

## Features

### 1. Virtual Library: A virtual library feature allowing users to search and discover books available at the Literary Latte book cafe. It fetches book information from an external API (Google Books API) and displays details such as book covers, titles, authors, and descriptions.

### 2. E-Shop: An e-commerce section allowing users to order food and beverages for delivery or pickup from the Literary Latte cafe. Users can browse the menu, add items to their cart, specify delivery preferences, and complete their orders online.

### 3. Component-driven development with React.js: It is integral to the construction of Literary Latte's user interface, embodying a modular approach where each feature, from VirtLibrary's book search functionality to the interactive Book Club section, is encapsulated within reusable components. By breaking down the UI into smaller, self-contained elements, such as navigation bars, form inputs, and card displays, Literary Latte's development process revolves around composing these components into a cohesive hierarchy, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. Through iterative refinement and testing, each component is crafted to fulfill a specific role, promoting reusability and facilitating the creation of a dynamic, engaging user experience reflective of Literary Latte's ethos as a hub for literature enthusiasts and cafe connoisseurs alike.

### 4. Customizable Styling: Tailwind CSS enables easy customization of all the UI components.

### 5. Animations: Incorporates Framer Motion and React Fast Marquee to incorporate animations in the application.

### 6. Food Delivery System: It has a food delivery system built to understand the state management of a React Application using Context API, with basic functionalities like add to Cart, delete from cart, proceed to cart, price calculation, etc.

### 7. Book Search Application: It has a book search functionality which uses Axios to handle HTTP requests and fetches data from google books API.
