        <h3 className='text-md m-8 sm:text-lg sm:m-16 md:text-xl md:m-20'>Founded by two avid readers and coffee enthusiasts, Literary Latte began as a humble dream to combine their passions for literature and coffee into a cozy community space. Bonding over their shared love for classic novels and gourmet brews, they envisioned a place where bookworms could gather, immerse themselves in their favorite stories, and savor the aroma of freshly brewed lattes.</h3>
        <h3 className='text-md m-8 sm:text-lg sm:m-16 md:text-xl md:m-20'>Drawing inspiration from their favorite literary works and the bustling cafe culture of their city, Emily and Ryan transformed a quaint corner space into Literary Latte, a welcoming sanctuary where the pages of beloved novels come to life amidst the chatter of coffee cups and the rustle of turning pages. From its modest beginnings, Literary Latte has grown into a beloved local haunt, cherished by bibliophiles and coffee aficionados alike for its warm ambiance, delicious beverages, and endless literary inspiration.</h3>
